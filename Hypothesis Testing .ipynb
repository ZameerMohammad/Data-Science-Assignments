A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in
the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of 
cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw 
inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests 
that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.
